# 🚗 Ola Sales Data Analysis

## 🧩 Business Problem

Ola, a leading ride-hailing service, collects a massive volume of transactional and operational data every day. However, raw data alone cannot guide strategic decisions. The business lacks a clear understanding of:

- Ride volume trends over time  
- Customer satisfaction across vehicle types  
- Payment method performance and cancellation patterns  
- High-value customers and driver efficiency

Without actionable insights, it’s difficult to improve service quality, reduce cancellations, and optimize revenue.

## 🎯 Project Goal

The goal of this project is to:

- Perform detailed analysis of Ola's ride, customer, and driver data
- Clean and prepare the dataset for structured querying
- Provide data-driven insights that can support strategy, marketing, and operations teams

This analysis can help Ola enhance user experience, improve driver engagement, and grow revenue.
